 This came up from the following reddit post: https://www.reddit.com/r/xamarindevelopers/comments/i0302m/looking_for_ideas_to_make_a_numeric_input_that/
 
I wanted to see if I could solve the problem. To me, it looks like Xamarin.Forms doesn't have the best support for this sort of behaviour. You could argue it's not a good UI choice anyway, and that would be fair. However, I think this solution could be built upon to produce something worthwhile, if you so desired.
